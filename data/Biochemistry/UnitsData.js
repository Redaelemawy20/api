      "This unit provides a unique service of its kind to serve the central delta governorates,Where this unit receives not less than 100 cases per month to diagnose hereditary metabolic diseases, which is unique in the middle of the delta region, where amino acids and acyl-carnitines are measured in blood, in addition to developing a method for measuring organic acids in urine, which enables rapid and confirmed diagnosis of genetic diseases in children, especially Newborns. It helpt to discovere many cases that were undiagnosed and are therefore believed to be extremely rare. This technology also greatly increased the efficiency of newborn screening programs, which gave the opportunity for early detection and treatment of children with disorders that were not diagnosed before permanent clinical damage occurred.The start-up of this unit was announced in the middle of 2015 and the health insurance contracted in the beginning of 2016. The number of samples received by the unit since the start of work has reached nearly one thousand samples.",
      "Recently, methods have been developed to measure bile acids in the plasma, which in turn contribute to the early emergence of congenital defects in the bile ducts.",
